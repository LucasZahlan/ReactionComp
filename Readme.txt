Reaction Time Game 🎯
Author: Lucas Zahlan

Overview
This is a Java-based reaction time game that tests how quickly a user can react when a green circle appears. The game uses the Processing library to handle graphics and timing.

🚀 How to Run the Project
Option 1: Using the Processing IDE (Easiest)
Download & Install Processing → Processing Download
Open the Processing application
Copy & Paste the ReactionComp.java code into a new sketch
Click the Run button ▶
Option 2: Running the Java File Manually
If you want to compile and run the game without the Processing IDE, follow these steps:

1️⃣ Install Java (if not already installed)
You need OpenJDK or Oracle JDK. Download the latest version here:
OpenJDK (Recommended)
Oracle JDK
2️⃣ Install Processing and Locate core.jar
Download Processing: https://processing.org/download
Find core.jar:
Windows: C:\Program Files\Processing\lib\core.jar
Mac: /Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Java/core.jar
Linux: /usr/share/processing/core.jar
3️⃣ Compile and Run the Program
Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
javac -cp "path/to/core.jar" ReactionComp.java
java -cp ".;path/to/core.jar" ReactionComp  # Windows
java -cp ".:path/to/core.jar" ReactionComp  # macOS/Linux
📌 Replace path/to/core.jar with the actual path where core.jar is located.
